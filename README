*Meaning of this name:

A Chinese translation of this project is 尔说, because `U`, same as `you`,
means `尔` in Chinese, and `So` has a similar pronounciation for `说` in 
Chinese.

Also, in Japanese, `U-So` means `lie`. It can remind us that what people 
says in these kind of social networking application is usually not trust-
worthy.

`#` means a conceptual node, and ` - ` means an entity (existist file).

equivelent to class, and in go, `{}` means type), and `()` means a method
of that class.
