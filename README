*Meaning of this name:

A Chinese translation of this project is 尔说, because `U`, same as `you`,
means `尔` in Chinese, and `So` has a similar pronounciation for `说` in 
Chinese.

Also, in Japanese, `U-So` means `lie`. It can remind us that what people 
says in these kind of social networking application is usually not trust-
worthy.

珍爱生命，远离社交软件。
